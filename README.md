# Credit Card Eligibility Insights: Understanding Approval Factors

ðŸ’³ðŸ“Š Credit Card Eligbility Insights ðŸ“ˆâœ… Welcome to the repository my final data visualization project with specialization in Excel. In this data analysis project, I explored the factors that determine credit card eligibility using a comprehensive dataset covering demographic, financial, and personal attributes. The analysis was performed to uncover patterns and relationships that financial institutions might consider when approving or rejecting credit card applications.

# **Project Overview**
The primary goals of the analysis were to:<br>
â€¢	Identify key trends in credit card approval based on housing, income, employment, and digital accessibility.<br>
â€¢	Analyze correlations between various attributes (e.g., employment stability, housing type, and communication tools).<br>
â€¢	Provide actionable insights to enhance understanding of credit card approval criteria and improve decision-making processes.<br>

This analysis provides insights into the impact of housing, income levels, employment duration, and communication access on credit card approval rates.
