## **Project Overview**
This analysis identifies trends and correlations in credit card approvals, focusing on factors such as housing, income, employment stability, and digital accessibility.

## **Objectives**
- **Trend Identification**: Discover key approval trends based on income, housing, and employment duration.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Examine relationships between approval likelihood and attributes like housing type, occupation, and communication tools.
- **Actionable Insights**: Provide recommendations to improve credit card eligibility assessments.

## **Dataset**
The **Credit Card Eligibility Dataset** from Kaggle includes:
- **Demographics**: Age, gender, family size.
- **Financial Data**: Income, account duration, employment years, income type.
- **Housing Info**: Car and property ownership, housing type.
- **Communication Tools**: Phone, work phone, and email access.
- **Outcome**: Whether an individual was approved or denied.

## **Key Insights**
- **Employment Stability**: Long-term employment does not strongly correlate with approval; short-duration occupations like "IT Staff" also saw approvals.
- **Housing Status**: Most approvals went to homeowners, but a significant number of applicants living with parents were also approved, indicating flexibility in financial criteria.
- **Income & Housing Type**: Homeowners generally have higher incomes, with the majority earning between $100,000â€“$300,000.
- **Digital Accessibility**: Access to communication tools (phone, email) was not a decisive factor for approval.

## **Highlights**
1. **Occupation & Approval**: Approval was granted across various occupations, including those with below-average employment duration, challenging the link between job stability and creditworthiness.
2. **Income & Homeownership**: High income correlates with homeownership, but it does not guarantee credit approval.
3. **Communication Tools**: Applicants with no or minimal access to communication tools had similar approval rates, suggesting these factors may be less relevant.

## **Future Directions**
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Assess customer feedback to understand applicant satisfaction with credit services.
- **Enhanced Feature Engineering**: Explore debt-to-income ratios or credit obligations for a more detailed creditworthiness assessment.

## **How to Use this Repository**
This repository contains:
- **Data Exploration Notebooks**: SQL and Excel-based analysis scripts.
- **Visualizations**: Data visualizations detailing insights into credit approval factors.
- **Findings Summary**: Key insights on how factors like employment and housing influence credit card eligibility.
